        <h1>Anyway, back to JavaScript!</h1>
        <h2>What to do?</h2>
        <p>So at this point in my review of my webdev curriculum, I pondered what to do to practice those sweet, sweet
            JavaScript chops. I could go back over the exercises and use JavaScript to determine how many pizzas Jane
            ordered or run the car.driveToWork method and code it to adjust the values for car.oilLife and car.mileage,
            maybe even set car.needsATuneUp to 'true', but I've done all that before. I wanted something new. Something
            exciting.</p>
        <h2>Enter Charles Petzold.</h2>
        <p>Since I had coded last, I'd started the book <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software">
                'CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software'</a> by Charles Petzold. It starts with an
            exercise designed to inspire the reader to count numbers in bases other than 10. Petzold then
            the general algorithm for calculating the value of a base-10 number into a base-whatever number. It
            seemed like a pretty enticing thing for me to try and automate myself, so here we go!</p>
        <h2>Here's the formula to convert any number to base q:</h2>
        <h3><i>N = x<sub>n</sub>q<sup>n</sup> + ... + x<sub>1</sub>q<sup>1</sup> + x<sub>0</sub>q<sup>0</sup></i></h3>
        <p>Where</p>
        <ul>
            <li>N is any integer</li>
            <li>x is the digit</li>
            <li>n is the position of the digit (starting with 0 for the "ones" place, 1 for "tens," etc.)</li>
            <li>q is the base value</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Here's where you enter your information:</h2>

        <form>
            Enter the number you'd like to convert:
            <input type="text" name="number"><br>
            Please select the base you'd like to convert it to:
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="2" checked>2 
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="3">3  
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="4">4  
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="5">5  
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="6">6  
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="7">7  
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="8">8  
            <input type="radio" name="radix" value="9">9
